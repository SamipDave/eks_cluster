## iam taking here example of jenkins so you can use same with bit changes to any other app to uninstall
To **completely remove Jenkins** from your server and free up port 8080 for your application, follow these steps based on your OS (assumed to be Ubuntu/Debian Linux unless you specify otherwise):

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Commands to Remove Jenkins

### 1. **Stop the Jenkins service**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop jenkins
```

### 2. **Disable it from starting on boot**

```bash
sudo systemctl disable jenkins
```

### 3. **Uninstall Jenkins**

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge jenkins -y
```

### 4. **Remove Jenkins config and leftover files**

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins
sudo rm -rf /etc/default/jenkins
sudo rm -rf /etc/init.d/jenkins
sudo rm -rf /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service
sudo rm -rf /var/log/jenkins
```

> If you installed Jenkins via a `.war` file or manually:
> Kill any running Jenkins process:

```bash
ps aux | grep jenkins
```

Then kill the process by PID:

```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

### 5. **Reload systemd and update**

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo apt-get autoremove -y
sudo apt-get autoclean
```

---

### ✅ Verify Jenkins is Gone:

Check if anything is running on port 8080:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :8080
```

If still something shows up, note the PID and kill it:

```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

Let me know if you're using a different OS or installed Jenkins some other way (e.g. Docker, Tomcat `.war`, etc.), and I’ll adjust accordingly.
